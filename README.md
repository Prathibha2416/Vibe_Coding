# Vibe_Coding
Vibe coding for Non-coders


To get the most out of vibe coding, clarity is key. 
Be specific when describing your project. Details about design, features, or mood 
help the AI generate better results. Iterate often with small adjustments rather 
than sweeping changes. Use each tool strategically. 

1) Lovable for full  web applications
2) Visio for UI components and Interfaces,
3) Gamma for presentations and content.
   
And always keep user experience in mind. Describe how you want people to feel when 
using your project. Starting your first project is easier than you think. Begin by 
choosing the right tool for your needs. Lovable, Visio, or Gamma. Then write a short 
description of what you want to build, who it's for, and its main features. Share 
your description with the AI and let it generate a first draft. From there, refine 
step by step until it feels right. 

# Your first vibe coding project:

1) *Choose your tools*: (Like: Lovable, vO, Gamma)
2) *Define Your Project*: Write 2-3 sentences describing what you want to create and who will use it
   include key features and your preferred visual style.
3) *Start the Conversation*: Input your description and let the AI generate your first version.
   Don't worry about perfection - you'll iterate and improve
4) *Refine and Iterate*: Request specific changes: adjust colors, modify layouts, add features
   or change functionality using natural language.
5) *Share and Celebrate*: Once you're happy with your creation, share it with friends, colleagues, or your target audience
   you've just completed your first vibe coding project!.


## Your First AI App

# Copy-Paste Prompts
# 1) Prompt 1 – Recipe Finder App

“Create a recipe finder app. The app should allow users to:

* Search for recipes by ingredient,

* Display a list of results with recipe name, cooking time, and difficulty
  level,

* Open a recipe detail page with ingredients and step-by-step instructions.
  Add a clean, modern design with a food-themed color palette (greens and
  oranges). Include a header that says ‘CookEasy’ and a search bar at the top.”

# 2) Prompt 2 – Personal Budget Tracker

“Build a personal budget tracker app. The app should:

* Let users add income and expenses with categories (Food, Rent, Transport,
  Entertainment),

* Show a running balance at the top,

* Include a pie chart that visualizes expenses by category,

* Allow users to edit or delete entries. Use a professional but friendly design
  with light blue and gray colors. Place the pie chart on the dashboard
  screen.”

# 3) Prompt 3 – Habit Tracker

“Create a habit tracker app. The app should:

* Let users add daily habits (e.g., Drink Water, Exercise, Read),

* Show checkboxes for each day of the week to mark progress,

* Display a weekly completion percentage for each habit,

* Include a motivational message like ‘Keep going!’ when users complete more
  than 70% of habits in a week. Design the app with soft pastel colors, rounded
